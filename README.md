## Prerequisites
* NodeJs (tested with v8.4.0)

Angular CLI can be installed by running 'npm install -g @angular/cli'

## How to run:
1. Run 'npm install' in the ngGitHouse folder to install all npm packages (you only need to do this once, or when you change/add npm packages).
2. Run 'ng build' to build the angular portion of the app.
3. Open solution and run project in Visual Studio.
4. Profit?

When developing, run' ng build --watch' to automatically compile angular files on save.
